The world indoor champion said: \"I got to the airport and my stomach was upset and I was vomiting. I almost went home. \"I felt a little better Sunday morning but decided I\\'d only run in the main race. Then everything went perfectly.\" Gardener, part of the Great Britain 4x100m quartet that won gold at the Athens Olympics, will now turn his attention to next weekend\\'s Norwich Union European Indoor trials in Sheffield.\\n\\n\"Given I am still off-colour I know there is plenty more in the tank and I expect to get faster in the next few weeks,\" he said. \"It\\'s just a case of chipping away as I have done in previous years and the results will come.\" Scotland\\'s Ian Mackie was also in action in Leipzig. He stepped down from his favoured 400m to 200m to finish third in 21.72 secs. Germany\\'s Alexander Kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with Dutchman Patrick van Balkom second in 21.58 secs. There were plenty of other senior British athletes showing their indoor form over the weekend. Promising 60m hurdler\\n\\nclocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway. The 24-year-old reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former AAA champion Diane Allahgreen in the final.\\n\\n, who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent. That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorio\\'s effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. At the same meeting,\\n\\nfinished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class women\\'s 60m. The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second. Britain\\'s Joice Maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist\\n\\nmade a low-key return to action at an indoor meeting in Birmingham. The 28-year-old cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the women\\'s shot put.', 'Hansen \\'delays return until 2006\\'\\n\\nBritish triple jumper Ashia Hansen has ruled out a comeback this year after a setback in her recovery from a bad knee injury, according to reports.\\n\\nHansen, the Commonwealth and European champion, has been sidelined since the European Cup in Poland in June 2004. It was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal. Her coach Aston Moore told the Times: \"We\\'re not looking at any sooner than 2006, not as a triple jumper.\" Moore said Hansen may be able to return to sprinting and long jumping sooner, but there is no short-term prospect of her being involved again in her specialist event. \"There was a problem with the wound healing and it set back her rehabilitation by about two months, but that has been solved and we can push ahead now,\" he said. \"The aim is for her to get fit as an athlete - then we will start looking at sprinting and the long jump as an introduction back to the competitive arena.\" Moore said he is confident Hansen can make it back to top-level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne next March, when she will be 34. \"It\\'s been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination,\" he added.', 'Chepkemei hit by big ban\\n\\nKenya\\'s athletics body has suspended two-time London Marathon runner-up Susan Chepkemei from all competition until the end of the year.\\n\\nAthletics Kenya (AK) issued the ban after Chepkemei failed to turn up for a cross country training camp in Embu. \"We have banned her from all local and international competitions,\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \"We shall communicate this decision to the IAAF and all meet directors all over the world.\" The 29-year-old finished second to Paula Radcliffe in the 2002 and 2003 London races, and was also edged out in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.\\n\\nBut the ban will prevent the two-time world half-marathon silver medallist from challenging Radcliffe at this year\\'s London event in April. Global Sports Communications, Chepkemei\\'s management company, said she had wanted to run in the World Cross Country Championships in March. But AK maintained it was making an example of Chepkemei as a warning to other Kenyan athletes. \"We are taking this action in order to salvage our pride,\" said Kiplagat. \"We have been accused of having no teeth to bite with and that agents are ruling over us.\" KA has also threatened three-time women\\'s short-course champion Edith Masai with a similar ban if reports that she feigned injury to avoid running at the cross country world championships are true. Masai missed the national trials in early February, but was included in the provisional team on the proviso that she ran in a regional competition. She failed to run in the event, citing a leg injury.', 'Collins to compete in Birmingham\\n\\nWorld and Commonwealth 100m champion Kim Collins will compete in the 60m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham on 18 February.\\n\\nThe St Kitts and Nevis star joins British Olympic relay gold medallists Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis. Sydney Olympic 100m champion and world indoor record holder Maurice Greene and Athens Olympic 100m silver medallist Francis Obikwelu will also take part. Collins ran in Birmingham at the 2003 World Indoor Championships. \"I\\'m looking forward to competing against such a strong field,\" he said. \"I got a great reception form the crowd at the NIA when I won my 60m world indoor silver medal in 2003 and it will be really exciting to return to this venue.\" The world champion says he\\'s in good shape but he isn\\'t underestimating the home competition. \"Jason Gardener and Mark Lewis-Francis are Olympic gold medallists now and I\\'m sure they\\'ll be aiming to win in front of their home supporters. \"I\\'m looking forward to competing against Britain\\'s best sprinters and I\\'m sure the 60 metres will be one of the most exciting races of the evening.\" Collins was sixth in the Olympic final in Athens but is hoping for a better result at the World Championships in Finland this summer. \"This will be a big year for me and I plan to defend my 100m world title in Helsinki in August. Before then I want to perform well over 60m indoors and start my year in winning form.\"', 'Isinbayeva claims new world best\\n\\nPole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva broke her own indoor world record by clearing 4.89 metres in Lievin on Saturday.\\n\\nIt was the Russian\\'s 12th world record of her career and came just a few days after she cleared 4.88m at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham. The Olympic champion went on to attempt 5.05m at the meeting on France but failed to clear that height. In the men\\'s 60m, former Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene could only finish second to Leonard Scott. It was Greene\\'s second consecutive defeat at the hands of his fellow American, who also won in Birmingham last week. \"I ran my race perfectly,\" said Scott, who won in 6.46secs, his best time indoors. \"I am happy even if I know that Maurice is a long way from being at his peak at the start of the season.\"', 'Edwards tips Idowu for Euro gold\\n\\nWorld outdoor triple jump record holder and BBC pundit Jonathan Edwards believes Phillips Idowu can take gold at the European Indoor Championships.\\n\\nIdowu landed 17.30m at the British trials in Sheffield last month to lead the world triple jump rankings. \"It\\'s all down to him, but if he jumps as well as he did in Sheffield he could win the gold medal,\" said Edwards. \"His ability is undoubted but all his best performances seem to happen in domestic meetings.\"\\n\\nIdowu made his breakthrough five years ago but so far has only a Commonwealth silver medal to his name. Edwards himself kept Idowu off top spot at the Manchester Games. But he believes the European Indoors in Madrid represent a chance for the 26-year-old to prove his credentials as Britain\\'s top triple jumper. \"He has to start producing at international level and here is the beginning,\" said Edwards. \"Phillips still needs to be much more consistent. I\\'m sure a victory in Madrid will build up his confidence and self-belief that he can be best in the world.\" The qualifying round of the men\\'s triple jump in Madrid takes place on Friday with the final scheduled for Saturday. Olympic champion Christian Olsson will not be taking part as he is out for the entire indoor season with an ankle injury.', 'Verdict delay for Greek sprinters\\n\\nGreek athletics\\' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou for missing doping tests.\\n\\nThe pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year\\'s Athens Olympics. They were set to learn their fate by the end of February, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. \"A decision is now expected by around mid-March,\" said one of their lawyers, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos. Kenteris, 31, who won the men\\'s 200m title at the 2000 Sydney Games and Thanou, 30, who won the women\\'s 100m silver medal in Sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. The athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the Athens Olympics, have been suspended by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) for missing the three tests. The IAAF said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and ordered Greek athletic\\'s governing body, Segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. The athletes also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the Athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. Following the final hearing in late January, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. \"I am confident and optimistic,\" Thanou had said at the time. \"We presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of.\" It was not clear what this new evidence was.', 'McIlroy aiming for Madrid title\\n\\nNorthern Ireland man James McIlroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend\\'s Spar European Indoor Championships in Madrid.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites. \"I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle,\" said McIlroy. New coach Tony Lester has helped get McIlroy\\'s career back on track. The 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. McIlroy now lives in Windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former Army sergeant Lester. Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season.\\n\\nMcIlroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for Ireland at the outdoor European Championships in 1998. \"That was my last decent year,\" said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester\\'s shrewd guidance. \"Before, every race was like trying to climb Mount Everest and I now know you can\\'t do it on your own. \"Trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line, which became a bit too much.\" McIlroy, who was compared to the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett in his younger days, is now competing without the benefit of National Lottery funding. That situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in Erfurt and Stuttgart earlier this season. Russian Dmitriy Bogdanov won at the same Madrid venue last week and then claimed the European Championship race would be between himself, Dutchman Arnoud Okken and Antonio Reina of Spain but McIlroy is unfazed.\\n\\nHe admitted: \"He looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. \"I never write myself off and let\\'s face it, I haven\\'t or looked like being beaten this season.\" And McIlroy, whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in Erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the UK All-Time list, is also already looking beyond Madrid. He said: \"I\\'ve been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. \"Ultimately of course, this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer\\'s world championships. \"That ambition has meant that I\\'ve had only two nights out since last August. The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.\"', 'UK Athletics agrees new kit deal\\n\\nUK Athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply Great Britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years.\\n\\nThe German-based firm kitted out Team GB at the 2004 Olympics and has deals with 20 other national Olympic bodies. UK Athletics chief David Moorcroft said: \"The Athens experience can now be extended to more major championships. \"In the year ahead these include the European indoor and World outdoor championships. We are delighted.\" Moorcroft added: \"It is hugely beneficial to the sport that the adidas commitment will also provide for officials and other personnel at our world-class series of live televised events.\" This week, UK Athletics also agreed a four-year deal with energy drink company, Red Bull, who will be supplying the product to athletics at major domestic meetings and in high performance centres.', 'Kenya lift Chepkemei\\'s suspension\\n\\nKenya\\'s athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner Susan Chepkemei after she made an official apology.\\n\\nAthletics Kenya (AK) had suspended the two-time London Marathon runner-up for failing to turn up to a cross-country team training camp in Embu. \"We have withdrawn the ban. Chepkemei has given a reason for her absence,\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \"She explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in Puerto Rice and we have accepted her apology.\"\\n\\nThe Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month\\'s world cross country championships. The 29-year-old would be a strong contender at the event in France and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the 32-strong squad. \"I am satisfied that the whole saga has been brought to an end,\" Chepkemei said. \"I am ready and prepared to represent my country. \"I will be disappointed if I am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships.\" AK had insisted it was making an example of Chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005. But the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision. The 29-year-old took part in the 2002 and 2003 London Marathons and was edged out by Radcliffe in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.\\n\\nThe two-time world half-marathon silver medallist will be back to challenge Radcliffe at this year\\'s London event in April. AK also dropped its harsh stance on three-time world cross country 4km champion Edith Masai. Masai missed Kenya\\'s world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but AK insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured. \"Subject to our doctor\\'s confirmation, we have decided to clear Masai,\" added Kiplagat.', 'Women MPs reveal sexist taunts\\n\\nWomen MPs endure \"shocking\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.\\n\\nMale MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \"melons\" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour\\'s Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \"Whose Secretary are You, minister\".\\n\\nThe research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \"Blair Babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say \\'melons\\' as we spoke.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women\\'s legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"Betty\".\\n\\n\"When I said, \\'Look you know my name isn\\'t Betty\\', he said, \\'ah but you\\'re all the same, so I call you all Betty\\'.\" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: \"Well, you\\'ve only succeeded because you\\'re a woman.\" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: \"Oh, you\\'ve had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.\\n\\nLiberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: \"Lots of people say it\\'s like an old boys club. \"I\\'ve always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \"We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: \"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \"What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.\" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.', 'Crucial decision on super-casinos\\n\\nA decision on whether to allow Westminster to legislate on super-casinos is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament.\\n\\nThe government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow. Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close.\\n\\nThe Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.', '\\'Errors\\' doomed first Dome sale\\n\\nThe initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government\\'s finance watchdog says.\\n\\nThe report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.\\n\\nThe NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"', 'Crisis \\'ahead in social sciences\\'\\n\\nA national body designed to tackle skills shortages in key subjects should be set up, a committee of MPs has said.\\n\\nThere was an \"absolute crisis\" in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts, the Commons science and technology committee added. \"Major problems\" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said. The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.\\n\\nThe council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. In its report on the council\\'s work the committee said: \"We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. This mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry, it said. \"It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council\\'s limited resources. \"If the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this.\" A national \"strategic capabilities fund\" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.', 'Blair rejects Tory terror offer\\n\\nTony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.\\n\\nThe Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.\\n\\nThe government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.\\n\\nMr Blair\\'s refusal to accept the Tories\\' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.\\n\\nThe Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four\\'s the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists. He went on to say: \"If we don\\'t get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.\\n\\nThe second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by \"an eminent and independent person\". \"I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,\" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"There\\'s a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.\" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a \"basic principle\" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: \"Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.\"', \"Talks held on Gibraltar's future\\n\\nTwo days of talks on the future of Gibraltar begin at Jack Straw's country residence later on Wednesday.\\n\\nOfficials at the two-day summit at the foreign secretary's official Kent house, Chevening, will plan a new forum on the Rock's future. In October, Mr Straw and his Spanish counterpart Miguel Moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give Gibraltarians a voice in their future. Most Gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain British.\\n\\nGibraltar's Chief Minister Peter Caruana will represent the British citizens living on the Rock, while Britain's Europe Director Dominick Chilcott will represent the UK. Madrid is being represented by Spain's director general for Europe, Jose Maria Pons. The initiative follows Spain's socialist government's decision to put its long-standing sovereignty ambitions on hold. Gibraltarians rejected plans for the Rock's sovereignty to be shared between Britain and Spain in a referendum organised by Gibraltar government.\", 'Howard rebuts asylum criticisms\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.\\n\\nMr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called \\'No More Mr Nasty\\'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would \"like to kick your cat\". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was \"much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover\" - although she denied having personal experience. \"I wasn\\'t at Cambridge - and it\\'s not personal experience - but I know people who were.\"\\n\\nDocumentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.\\n\\nHe replies: \"What is the inference of that? \"That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you\\'re not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? \"That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.\"\\n\\nMs Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major\\'s government. \"I used to have to sit on my hands because he\\'d get on television and give a passable impression of someone who\\'d like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian.\" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner\\'s impression of him as Dracula, which he calls \"good fun\", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: \"Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it\\'s quite fun.\"\\n\\nFormer Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour\\'s election campaign, says a \"touchy-feely\" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents\\' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a \"big strategy\", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as \"absolutely rubbish\", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair\\'s failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is \"conceivable\" it could win the next election. But he adds: \"It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.\"\\n\\n- Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.', 'PM apology over jailings\\n\\nTony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK\\'s biggest miscarriages of justice.\\n\\nThe prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\".\\n\\nThe families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister\\'s Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. \"You could see he was moved by what people were saying. \"Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It\\'s a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair\\'s official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister\\'s statement brought to them\".\\n\\nMost of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon\\'s father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\\n\\n\"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon\\'s case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.', 'Watchdog probes e-mail deletions\\n\\nThe information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.\\n\\nRichard Thomas \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It\\'s only when you\\'ve got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.', 'Straw to attend Auschwitz service\\n\\nForeign Secretary Jack Straw will visit Auschwitz for the 60th anniversary of the former Nazi concentration camp\\'s liberation, it has been announced.\\n\\nPrince Edward will also join the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz. The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been \"shamed\" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: \"I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. \"Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.\"\\n\\nIn Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation\\'s commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James\\'s Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen\\'s grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets\\' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself \"the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear\", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.', 'Apple laptop is \\'greatest gadget\\'\\n\\nThe Apple Powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by US magazine Mobile PC.\\n\\nThe 1991 laptop was chosen because it was one of the first \"lightweight\" portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook PCs. The magazine has compiled an all-time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the Sony Walkman at number three and the 1956 Zenith remote control at two. Gadgets needed moving parts and/or electronics to warrant inclusion. The magazine specified that gadgets also needed to be a \"self-contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device\".\\n\\n\"In general we included only items that were potentially mobile,\" said the magazine.\\n\\n\"In the end, we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget,\" it concluded. The oldest \"gadget\" in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 A.D., and put in 60th place. Other pre-electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 (59th position), the marine chronometer from 1761 (42nd position) and the Kodak Brownie camera from 1900 (28th position). The Tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player (Diamound Multimedia), as well as the first \"successful\" digital camera (Casio QV-10) and mobile phone (Motorola Startac). The most popular gadget of the moment, the Apple iPod, is at number 12 in the list while the first Sony transistor radio is at number 13.\\n\\nSony\\'s third entry in the top 20 is the CDP-101 CD player from 1983. \"Who can forget the crystalline, hiss-free blast of Madonna\\'s Like A Virgin emenating from their first CD player?\" asked the magazine. Karl Elsener\\'s knife, the Swiss Army Knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list. Gadgets which could be said to feature surprisngly low down in the list include the original telephone (23rd), the Nintendo GameBoy (25th), and the Pulsar quartz digital watch (36th). The list also contains plenty of oddities: the Pez sweet dispenser (98th), 1980s toy Tamagotchi (86th) and the bizarre Ronco inside the shell egg scrambler (84th).\\n\\nWhy worry about mobile phones. Soon they will be subsumed into the PDA\\'s / laptops etc.\\n\\nWhat about the Marine Chronometer? Completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries. For it\\'s time, a technological marvel!\\n\\nSony Net Minidisc! It paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market. I always used my NetMD, and could not go anywhere without it.\\n\\nA laptop computer is not a gadget! It\\'s a working tool!\\n\\nThe Sinclair Executive was the world\\'s first pocket calculator. I think this should be there as well.\\n\\nHow about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or a pocket calculator? All these things are useful to real people, not just PC magazine editors.\\n\\nAre the people who created this list insane ? Surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone? It has revolutionalised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop. From outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.\\n\\nHas everyone forgot about the Breville pie maker??\\n\\nAn interesting list. Of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc - the Tandy 100. The size of A4 paper and light, three weeks on a set of batteries, an excellent keyboard, a modem. A pity Tandy did not make it DOS compatible.\\n\\nWhat\\'s an Apple Powerbook 100 ? It\\'s out of date - not much of a \"gadget\". Surely it has to be something simple / timeless - the tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves ?\\n\\nIt has to be the mobile phone. No other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.\\n\\nThe ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever. Also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule.\\n\\nThe Casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980. A true gadget, it could be carried around and shown off.\\n\\nAll top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high-tech obsession than anyhting else. I say this as the Swiss Army Knife only made No 20.\\n\\nSinclair QL a machine far ahead of its time. The first home machine with a true multi-takings OS. Shame the marketing was so bad!!!\\n\\nApple.. a triumph of fashion over... well everything else.\\n\\nUtter rubbish. Yes, the Apple laptop and Sony Walkman are classic gadgets. But to call the sextant and the marine chronometer \\'gadgets\\' and rank them as less important than a TV remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective. The former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see. The latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed. No competition.\\n\\nI\\'d also put Apple\\'s Newton and the first Palm Pilot there as the front runners for portable computing, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto for the same reason. I only wish that Vulcan Inc\\'s Flipstart wasn\\'t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top.\\n\\nHow did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone (mobile or otherwise)? What about radios and TVs?\\n\\nThe swiss army knife. By far the most useful gadget. I got mine 12 years ago. Still wearing and using it a lot! It stood the test of time.\\n\\nPsion Organiser series 3, should be up there. Had a usable qwerty keyboard, removable storage, good set of apps and programmable. Case design was good (batteries in the hinge - a first, I think). Great product innovation.\\n\\nThe first mobile PC was voted best gadget by readers of...err... mobile PC?! Why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site? It\\'s obviously the mobile phone or remote control, and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that.\\n\\nThe Motorola Startac should be Number One. Why? There will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.\\n\\nThe Psion series 3c! The first most practical way to carry all your info around...\\n\\nI too would back the Sinclair Spectrum - without this little beauty I would never have moved into the world of IT and earn the living that I do now.\\n\\nI\\'d have put the mobile phone high up the list. Probably a Nokia model.\\n\\nSinclair Spectrum - 16k. It plugged into the tv. Games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that\\'s what I do for a living now.\\n\\nI wish more modern notebooks -- even Apple\\'s newest offerings -- were more like the PB100. Particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball, which has given way to the largely useless \"trackpad\" which every notebook on the market today uses. They\\'re invariably inaccurate, uncomfortable, and cumbersome to use.\\n\\nCongratulations to Apple, a deserved win!', 'Virus poses as Christmas e-mail\\n\\nSecurity firms are warning about a Windows virus disguising itself as an electronic Christmas card.\\n\\nThe Zafi.D virus translates the Christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. Anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. Anti-virus firm Sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the Zafi virus.\\n\\nLike many other Windows viruses, Zafi-D plunders Microsoft Outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. To be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. The attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic Christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.\\n\\nThe virus\\' subject line says \"Merry Christmas\" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. The message in the body of the e-mail reads: \"Happy Holidays\" and this too is translated. On infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the PC to hand over control to the writer of the virus. The virus is thought to have spread most widely in South America, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria and Hungary. The original Zafi virus appeared in April this year. \"We have seen these hoaxes for several Christmases already, and personally I prefer traditional pen and paper cards, and we recommend this to all our clients too,\" said Mikko Hypponen, who heads F-Secure\\'s anti-virus team.', 'Britons fed up with net service\\n\\nA survey conducted by PC Pro Magazine has revealed that many Britons are unhappy with their internet service.\\n\\nThey are fed up with slow speeds, high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. It is particularly bad news for BT, the UK\\'s biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.\\n\\nA third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro Magazine. \"We expect these figures to leap in 2005. Every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch,\" he said. The survey found that BT and Tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. Some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping.\\n\\nOther found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. Broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. \"We discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier,\" said Tim Danton, editor of PC Pro. \"This breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there\\'s nothing we or Ofcom can do to help,\" he said. There is a vast choice of internet service providers in the UK now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. With prices set to drop even further in coming months Mr Danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. \"If you just stick with your current connection then there\\'s every chance you\\'re being ripped off,\" he warned.', 'Google\\'s toolbar sparks concern\\n\\nSearch engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.\\n\\nThe AutoLink feature comes with Google\\'s latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book\\'s ISBN number on the site. It also links to Google\\'s map service, if there is an address, or to car firm Carfax, if there is a licence plate. Google said the feature, available only in the US, \"adds useful links\". But some users are concerned that Google\\'s dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon.\\n\\nAutoLink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.\\n\\nIf a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book\\'s unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon\\'s website. It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find they are directing users to Amazon.com whether they like it or not. Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. Dan Gillmor, founder of Grassroots Media, which supports citizen-based media, said the tool was a \"bad idea, and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth\". In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. It said: \"The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button, and web pages she views will never be modified. \"In addition, the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time.\"\\n\\nThe new tool has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users. It was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service. Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any \"click through\" to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow, European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation, said that Google should not be penalised for its market dominance. \"Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. \"But as an end user I would want to know - \\'Can I choose to use this service?, \\'How much is Google being paid?\\', \\'Can I substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by Google?\\'.\" Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or \"tricked into using the service\".', 'Wi-fi web reaches farmers in Peru\\n\\nA network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in Peru.\\n\\nThe pilot scheme in the Huaral Valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital Lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. The Agricultural Information Project for Farmers of the Chancay-Huaral Valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. More than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.\\n\\nThe 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. The network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in September.\\n\\nThe non-government organisation, Cepes (Peruvian Centre for Social Studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the Education and Agriculture ministries, and European development organisations. \"The plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,\" said Carlos Saldarriaga, technical coordinator at Cepes. Farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. The Board of Irrigation Users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.\\n\\nOne of the key elements of the project is the Agricultural Information System, with its flagship huaral.org website. There, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. The system also helps the inhabitants of the Chancay-Huaral Valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. \"Water is the main element that unites them all. It is a precious element in Peru\\'s coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,\" Mr Saldarriaga told the BBC News website. The information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of Peru and even around the world.\\n\\nCepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project\\'s success. \"Throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,\" said Mr Saldarriaga. The community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. \"We have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. But we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives.\" So far, the Huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers\\' organisations in Peru. \"This is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,\" underlined Mr Saldarriaga.\\n\\nThe Cepes researcher recalls what happened in Cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. There it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kW worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. \"It was already dark when the technicians realised they didn\\'t have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,\" recalls Carlos Saldarriaga. \"The logical answer was \\'we don\\'t sell any\\', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing.\" Now, with the wireless network, Cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.', \"Security scares spark browser fix\\n\\nMicrosoft is working on a new version of its Internet Explorer web browser.\\n\\nThe revamp has been prompted by Microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. Microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. Test versions of the new program, called IE 7, are due to be released by the summer.\\n\\nThe announcement about Internet Explorer was made by Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the RSA Security conference currently being held in San Francisco. Although details were scant, Mr Gates, said IE7 would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. This last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.\\n\\nIn a bid to shore up the poor security in IE 6, Microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. Earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the IE browser. Microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. One of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a Microsoft anti-spyware program. An own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. The decision to make Internet Explorer 7 is widely seen as a U-turn because, before now, Microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. Typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the Windows operating system. A new version of IE was widely expected to debut with the next version of Windows, codenamed Longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006. The current version of Internet Explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as Firefox and Opera. There are also persistent rumours that search engine Google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on Firefox. In particular the Firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in November 2004. Estimates of how many users Firefox has won over vary widely. According to market statistics gathered by Websidestory, Firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. However, other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. Some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the Firefox browser. Internet Explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.\", 'Global blogger action day called\\n\\nThe global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned Iranian bloggers.\\n\\nThe month-old Committee to Protect Bloggers\\' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 February to the \"Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\". Arash Sigarchi and Mojtaba Saminejad are both in prison in Iran. Blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. Iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. \"I hope this day will focus people,\" Curt Hopkins, director of the Committee, told the BBC News website.\\n\\nThe group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local Iranian embassies. The Committee has deemed Tuesday \"Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\" as part of its first campaign. It is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of Mojtaba and Arash as well as other \"cyber-dissidents\". \"If you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except \\'Free Mojtaba and Arash Day\\',\" said Mr Hopkins. \"That would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. That alone will shine some light on the situation. \"If you don\\'t have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds.\" Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. A blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a US research think-tank.\\n\\nThe Committee to Protect Bloggers was started by US blogger Curt Hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger Ellen Simonetti as a deputy director. She has since started the International Bloggers\\' Bill of Rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. Although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.\\n\\nThe Committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. \"Blogging is in this weird no man\\'s land. People think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,\" said Mr Hopkins. \"Some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. \"But they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.\"\\n\\nIt is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. The question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. High profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.\\n\\n\"This is a big messy argument,\" explained Mr Hopkins. He added: \"It is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs.\" But the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said Mr Hopkins, \"is part of the whole messy conversation.\" \"If you haven\\'t already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don\\'t have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. Mr Hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. \"Everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,\" he said. Many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. \"That is the essential difference. What I call \\'templating software\\' gives every single person on Earth the chance to have one. \"You don\\'t even have to have your own computer.\"', 'EU software patent law faces axe\\n\\nThe European Parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.\\n\\nPoliticians unanimously rejected the bill and now it must go through another round of consultation if it is to have a chance of becoming law. During consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re-drafted or even scrapped. The bill was backed by some hi-tech firms, saying they needed protections it offered to make research worthwhile.\\n\\nHugo Lueders, European director for public policy at CompTIA, an umbrella organization for technology companies, said only when intellectual property was adequately protected would European inventors prosper. He said the benefits of the bill had been obscured by special interest groups which muddied debate over the rights and wrongs of software patents. Other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the American system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software. But opponents of the bill said that it could stifle innovation, be abused by firms keen to protect existing monopolies and could hamper the growth of the open source movement. The proposed law had a troubled passage through the European parliament. Its progress was delayed twice when Polish MEPs rejected plans to adopt it. Also earlier this month the influential European Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) said the law should be re-drafted after it failed to win the support of MEPs. To become law both the European Parliament and a qualified majority of EU states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill. The latest rejection means that now the bill on computer inventions must go back to the EU for re-consideration.', 'Xbox power cable \\'fire fear\\'\\n\\nMicrosoft has said it will replace more than 14 million power cables for its Xbox consoles due to safety concerns.\\n\\nThe company said the move was a \"preventative step\" after reports of fire hazard problems with the cables. It affects Xboxes made before 23 October 2003 for all regions but mainland Europe - and consoles in that region made before 13 January 2004. Microsoft said it had received 30 reports of minor injury or property damage due to faulty cables. The firm said fewer than one in 10,000 consoles had experienced component failures. The recall affects almost three quarters of all Xboxes sold around the world since its launch in 2001.\\n\\nIn a statement, it added: \"In almost all instances, any damage caused by these failures was contained within the console itself or limited to the tip of the power cord at the back of the console.\" But in seven cases, customers reported sustaining a minor burn to their hand. In 23 cases, customers reported smoke damage, or minor damage to a carpet or entertainment centre. \"This is a preventative step we\\'re choosing to take despite the rarity of these incidents,\" said Robbie Bach, senior vice president, Microsoft home and entertainment division. \"We regret the inconvenience, but believe offering consumers a free replacement cord is the responsible thing to do.\" Consumers can order a new cable from the Xbox website or by telephoning 0800 028 9276 in the UK. Microsoft said customers would get replacement cords within two to four weeks from the time of order. It advised users to turn off their Xboxes when not in use. A follow-up to Xbox is expected to released at the end of this year or the beginning of 2006.', 'UK pioneers digital film network\\n\\nThe world\\'s first digital cinema network will be established in the UK over the next 18 months.\\n\\nThe UK Film Council has awarded a contract worth £11.5m to Arts Alliance Digital Cinema (AADC), who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. AADC will oversee the selection of cinemas across the UK which will use the digital equipment. High definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly British and specialist films. Most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. The new network will double the world\\'s total of digital screens. Cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.\\n\\nEach film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. Fiona Deans, associate director of AADC, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.\\n\\nThe film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. \"People will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. \"The picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.\"\\n\\nThe key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of British films, documentaries and foreign language films.\\n\\n\"Access to specialised film is currently restricted across the UK,\" said Pete Buckingham, head of Distribution and Exhibition at the UK Film Council. \"Although a genuine variety of films is available in central London and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the Digital Screen Network will improve access for audiences across the UK,\" Digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said Ms Deans. \"It can cost up to £1,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. \"In the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. \"Distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer.\" The UK digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. A separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in May. The sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. \"Some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don\\'t need to be shown twice a day,\" explained Ms Deans. \"A cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. \"With digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy.\"']\n",

            "\n",
            "Ex-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2's Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour's controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a \"silly fuss\". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign.\n",
            "\n",
            "The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \"demonising\" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: \"Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!\" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.\n",
            "\n",
            "He said: \"Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. \"Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. \"Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. \"Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Later the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell's use of abusive language. The spokesman said: \"The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.\" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \"very good and polite relations\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \"very talented\". But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: \"I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists.\" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new \"sinister and underhand tactics\" by Labour.\n"

The small accuracy can be due to the the relative small size of the documents (only 150 words per document before removing stop words) and also to the small number of iterations (20000, with a burn in period of 1000) which are not enough for convergence. We can see that 50% of the documents have the correct most frequent topic.\n",
